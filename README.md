# Arbitrage Betting Calculator

A calculator that identifies arbitrage betting opportunities.

Arbitrage betting means betting in a way that there is no risk of loss.

This is possible by betting on all possible outcomes, granted that certain conditions are met.

This calculator checks these conditions and produces the (positive or negative) profit under each of the outcomes of a win, a loss or a draw.
